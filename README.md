# sdsreader

Nova Fitness SDS011, SDS018, and SDS021 sensors are cheap Particulate Matter (PM) sensors that can be easily connected to a Raspberry PI.

The sdsreader software runs on Raspberry PI 3 Model B, and allows to read PM data from SDS sensors and post it to the Dusty web application <http://dusty.pythonanywhere.com/pm>
